main.py simply parses through books.csv to create 3 main INSERT statement (sometimes more depending on number of
authors).

It should be known that the code does also account for duplicate author names. If an author has already been given and
id, then author's id gets used instead of assigning them a new one.
*****NOTE*****: I've found a few errors in the original books.csv file, the one provided is my updated one fixing some
of these errors. The errors are inconsistent spelling of names, such as: Mclaughlin spelled as McLaughlin and
J.K. Rowling spelled as "J. K. Rowling". Little inconsistencies like these may impact how accurate the author's ids are,
 so keep that in mind. I'll try and update the file if I find any more.
 *****NOTE*****: I fear that if he were to query for books by "J. K. Rowling", nothing will show up, since I
 have changed the name to "J.K. Rowling". So to avoid that from happening, I am adding the booksOG.csv as the original
 copy of the books.csv file to stay consistent with what the professor has provided us. The script has been altered to
 reflect and account for this change, as it will now open "booksOG.csv", so keep that in mind.

It is only formatted to parse through books.csv and not borrowers.csv as of 10/17.

The python file creates a text file named "insertSTMTS" but this can be changed to your liking.

Be sure that books.csv and main.py are within the same folder when running main. A project folder in PyCharm is what I
used.

This code works for me as of right now, 10/17, if you have any concerns on how to run or execute, let me know in
discord, thank you.
