This is simply an SQL text file. I tried to use the "Run SQL Script..." option in MySQL workbench, but it was
unsuccessful. Instead, I opened the file using the "Open SQL Script..." option. To do this:
1. Here is where I clicked File, clicked "Open SQL Script..." and then found the "create-library-database.sql" file.
When I opened this file in the workshop, it took a second to load so if your workshop isn't responding, give it a
minute to process your request of opening a file with 98,000 lines haha.
2. Once everything loads, you should be able to simply click the little lightening bolt that will run every command.
3. If there were no errors creating the database, you should see it in the list of schemas. If not, click the little
refresh button on the Navigator window. If it still doesn't show up, try seeing what error it gave you at the bottom of
the workshop.
4. If there were any errors in running the script, please let me know on discord and I'll fix them asap. If there were
no errors, then you should be able to run these few commands to make sure the script ran smoothly:
            select * from authors where authorID = 1825;
            select * from book_authors where authorID = 1825;
            select * from authors order by AuthorID DESC;
            select * from borrower order by card_id desc;

    My database had AuthorIDs ranging from 1-15649, if you wanted to compare and see if it ran like mine did.
    My database had Card_ids ranging from 1-1000, if you wanted to compare and see if it ran like mine did.
