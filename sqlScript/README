This is simply an SQL text file. I tried to use the "Run SQL Script..." option in MySQL workbench, but it was
unsuccessful. Instead, I opened the file using the "Open SQL Script..." option. To do this:
1. Once inside your workbench and connected to your MySQL Connection, run this line of code:
                    create database library;
The name "library" will be used in other parts of this project, so to keep things simple I'd keep this name the same.
2. Next, make sure you're on the Schemas tab on the left side of the screen in the Navigator.
3. If there were no errors creating the database, you should see it in the list of schemas. If not, click the little
refresh button on the Navigator window. If it still doesn't show up, try seeing what error it gave you at the bottom of
the workshop.
4. Assuming you can see the database, double click on it to "use" this database for any queries or updates you're going
to do.
5. Here is where I clicked File, clicked "Open SQL Script..." and then found the "create-library-database.sql" file.
When I opened this file in the workshop, it took a second to load so if your workshop isn't responding, give it a
minute to process your request of opening a file with 97,000 lines haha.
6. Once everything loads, you should be able to simply click the little lightening bolt that will run every command.
7. If there were any errors in running the script, please let me know on discord and I'll fix them asap. If there were
no errors, then you should be able to run these few commands to make sure the script ran smoothly:
            select * from authors where authorID = 1825;
            select * from book_authors where authorID = 1825;
            select * from authors order by AuthorID DESC;

    My database had AuthorIDs ranging from 1-15649, if you wanted to compare and see if it ran like mine did.
